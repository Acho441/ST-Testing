Website interactions testable things
    Will the website work if multiple websites are running at the same time?
    Does the button work?
    Is there a response?
    Is it possible to break the website?

How to test:
    To test these you will need to have the web.py running, the api.py, and to use
    the website interface, and get the strength of the test data

Results of the password strength tests:
    Testable strong passwords returned good

    Testable bad passwords returned bad

    Testable passwords returned bad

Results of the website interaction tests:
    The website works with multiple being open at the same time

    The button works properly

    There is always a response when clicking the button

    I have not found a way to break the website.

Things That are worth considering testing but dont know how:
    Can it handle foreign languages like Mandarin
    Stress testing it if somebody puts a extremely long password
    writing a generator to generate passwords of random length to test
