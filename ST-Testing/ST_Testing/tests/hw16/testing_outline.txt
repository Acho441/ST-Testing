Website interactions testable things
    Will the website work if multiple websites are running at the same time?
    Does the button work?
    Is there a response?

How to test:
    To test these you will need to have the web.py running, the api.py, and to use
    the website interface, and get the strength of the test data

Results of the tests:
    The passwords that were complex returned good for strength
    The passwords that were not complex enoough returned bad for strength
    The passwords that used complexifiers that are not recognized gave bad strength
    You can have multiple website pages up, and they work fine
    The button works properly
    There is always a response

Things That are worth considering testing but dont know how:
    Can it handle foreign languages like Mandarin
    Stress testing it if somebody puts a extremely long password
